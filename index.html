<h1>Save Congestion Pricing</h1>
<p>Gov. Kathy Hochul has announced an intention to "indefinitely pause" the scheduled rollout of congestion pricing on June 30.</p>
<p><strong>Your voice is urgently needed to stand up for a funded MTA with increased accessbility, a healthy planet, and good government in New York. Stop a $15 billion disaster and take action today!</strong></p>

<p>Congestion pricing will <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/heres-how-nyc-subway-service-could-suffer-now-that-congestion-pricing-is-effectively-dead">provide $15 billion in badly-needed funding for infrastructure improvements to the subway and other MTA projects.</a> The state legislature passed the congestion pricing law <strong>years</strong> ago, and the program is set to begin on June 30.</p>
<p><strong>New Yorkers need the original congestion pricing program to fund these transit improvements.</strong> We cannot let Gridlock Governor Kathy Hochul's reckless actions burden us decades more of congestion and bad air quality. Her proposed plan to find an alternative funding source unjustly places the cost burden on hardworking, transit-riding New Yorkers.</p>

<p><b>Friday, June 7, 2 PM: Speaker of the Assembly Carl Heastie is trying to get his colleagues to vote for Hochul's plan as if she had already paused congestion pricing as a given.</b> <a href="https://twitter.com/bern_hogan/status/1799137234748064199">"That's been decided already," he says</a>, even though it is the opposite of what the Assembly decided. <a href="https://twitter.com/JonCampbellNY/status/1799138674568995206">"The plan is to be here late into tonight."</a></p>

<p>Some activists have reported similar sentiments from other legislators <a href="https://twitter.com/nathanriddleles/status/1799082671945261530">Sen. Brian Kavanagh</a>. When you call, be specific in your comment - <a href="https://twitter.com/transalt/status/1799061366743130506">"Congestion pricing or bust!"</a></p>

<p><b>Friday, June 7, 7 AM: Sen. Liz Krueger, finance committee chaie, writes in the <i>Daily News</i> that <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/2024/06/07/killing-the-mtas-toll-program-breaks-state-law/?share=hnsp0ny0eispaawt0twt">Hochul's last-minute plan is illegal</a>.</b>
    Notably: "The governor has stated that she has a billion dollars available to replace congestion pricing as a funding source for this year, but as the chair of the Senate Finance Committee, I am not aware of any such funds, and she has not given the Legislature any indication of their location."
    <br>Sen. Michael Gianaris, deputy majority leader, <a href="https://twitter.com/bern_hogan/status/1798926795066261668">has not heard a coherent plan either</a>.<br>
    We are waiting for the Senate to resume session at 11 AM.</p>
<p><b>Thursday, June 6, 11:15 PM: A last-minute deal is still on the table for tomorrow morning.</b> <a href="https://twitter.com/2AvSagas/status/1798915391621926929">Senate leadership is still trying to whip votes</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/ZachReports/status/1798916358195044517">won't call a vote "tonight"</a> but might call one in a couple of hours.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/joncampbellny/status/1798889748527972462">Jon Campbell</a>, WNYC/Gothamist: Hearing this measure is set to include language that pledges $1b a year for 15 years to back the MTA’s bonds, but doesn’t identify a source.

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/davecoion/status/1798831326516383826">Dave Colon</a>, Streetsblog: Multiple legislative sources say that Governor Hochul’s new offer to law makers is to raid the general fund for up to a billion dollars to patch up the capital plan, and then to find a congestion pricing revenue replacement when legislators come back in 2025</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/ReinventAlbany/status/1798828831635374591">Reinvent Albany</a>: Fact check: 2019 congestion pricing law says CP must raise net revenue of $15B for MTA 2020-2024 capital plan + allows MTA to do CP.  That $15B comes from bonding CP tolls for 25/30 years = rev in unbreakable lock box. This is NOT the same as $1B from general fund, which the state can reneg on at anytime</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/bern_hogan/status/1798857331473801485">Bernadette Hogan</a>, NY1: New: Source says the legislature is expected vote on a bill as soon as tonight that would commit $1B in state funding for the MTA.
