<h1>What's going on with NYC congestion pricing?</h1>
<p>Gov. Kathy Hochul has announced an intention to "indefinitely pause" the scheduled rollout of congestion pricing on June 30. Here's how it affects you and how you can get involved in the effort to save congestion pricing.</p>

<p>Congestion pricing was set to supply <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/heres-how-nyc-subway-service-could-suffer-now-that-congestion-pricing-is-effectively-dead">$15 billion in badly-needed funding for infrastructure improvements to the subway and other MTA projects.</a>. The legislature passed the congestion pricing law years ago, but the law didn't specify a specific starting date. Gov. Hochul cannot ignore the law but she can certainly try to put it off forever.</p>
<p>Her original plan was an increased payroll tax on NYC businesses to make up for the lost funding, which was rejected by the legislature. She is now trying to convince the legislature to agree to some alternative sources of funding.</p>
<h2>Latest news</h2>
<p><b>Thursday, June 6, 9:30 PM: The governor is trying to get the legislature to agree to a last-minute deal to spend $1B of state funds instead.</b></p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/joncampbellny/status/1798889748527972462">Jon Campbell</a>, WNYC/Gothamist: Hearing this measure is set to include language that pledges $1b a year for 15 years to back the MTA’s bonds, but doesn’t identify a source. The payroll tax hike is dead dead. Assembly whipping votes now; Senate discussing, too.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/davecoion/status/1798831326516383826">Dave Colon</a>, Streetsblog: Multiple legislative sources say that Governor Hochul’s new offer to law makers is to raid the general fund for up to a billion dollars to patch up the capital plan, and then to find a congestion pricing revenue replacement when legislators come back in 2025</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/ReinventAlbany/status/1798828831635374591">Reinvent Albany</a>: Fact check: 2019 congestion pricing law says CP must raise net revenue of $15B for MTA 2020-2024 capital plan + allows MTA to do CP.  That $15B comes from bonding CP tolls for 25/30 years = rev in unbreakable lock box. This is NOT the same as $1B from general fund, which the state can reneg on at anytime</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/bern_hogan/status/1798857331473801485">Bernadette Hogan</a>, NY1: New: Source says the legislature is expected vote on a bill as soon as tonight that would commit $1B in state funding for the MTA. Legislature and gov are working towards a deal. Money would come from general fund/bonded out - still unclear.</p>
<p><b>Thursday, June 6, 4 PM: The governor's proposal for an increased payroll tax has been rejected by the state senate.</b> <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/06/06/payroll-tax-hike-hochul-rejected-00162136"><i>Politico</i> has a full report on the rejection</a>, and <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/gov-hochuls-congestion-toll-flip-flop-spurs-mad-scramble-at-ny-capitol"><i>Gothamist</i> has details on the moribund proposal to significantly increase NYC payroll taxes</a>, which was, unsurprisingly, unpopular with local businesses.</p>
